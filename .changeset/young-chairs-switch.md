Customer related information was stored in the users local storage indefintely causing cache mismatches: 1. It stores a lot less by using the newly created _persistenceMapper_. 2. The 'createCacheReviver' would recreate the ApolloClient-cache on each navigation, it wont do that anymore. 3. The _persistenceMapper_ now has a hard coded blacklist of entries that aren't allowed to be stored in the local storage. In a future PR we'll make this blacklist configurable.
